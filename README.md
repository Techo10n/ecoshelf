# EcoShelf

### A Chrome Extension for online shopping that calculates the emissions produced from shipping a product, recommending more sustainable alternatives with similar price points.

Instead of telling consumers to completely change what theyâ€™re shopping for, our project aims to help users sort through the dozens of near identical products on sites such as Amazon and allow them to prioritize sustainability without sacrificing on functionality or price. When users find a product they like, our extension will notify them of any other vendors selling the same product that would produce less emissions when shipping it, making sure to stay within a similar price point range.
